# üñ•Ô∏è Java Programs with DSA  

Welcome to my **Java Programs Repository**! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of basic Java programs alongside **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implementations. It's designed to help beginners learn Java fundamentals and explore advanced concepts like DSA through practical examples.  

## üìå What's Included?  

### Basic Java Programs:  
- Control structures (if-else, loops, switch-case)  
- Functions and recursion  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts  
- Exception handling  
- File handling  

### Data Structures:  
- Arrays and Strings  
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, and Circular)  
- Stacks and Queues  
- Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs, and more)  
- Graphs (DFS, BFS)  

### Algorithms:  
- Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, etc.)  
- Searching algorithms (Linear, Binary Search)  
- Dynamic programming (Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence)  
- Greedy algorithms (Prim‚Äôs, Kruskal‚Äôs)  
- Backtracking (N-Queens, Sudoku Solver)  

## üîß Technologies Used  
- **Language**: Java  
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code  

## üöÄ How to Run
